This project focuses on predicting house prices in King County, USA, using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and location. We clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and transforming categorical variables. The project applies regression models, such as Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressors, to forecast house prices. Model evaluation metrics, including Mean Absolute Error and R-Squared, help assess prediction accuracy. The final model provides insights into how property characteristics influence market value, assisting potential buyers, sellers, and real estate agents with data-driven decisions.
